    "Ans: Because consecutive layers are only partially connected and because it heavily reuses its weights, a CNN has many fewer \n",

    "Ans: CNN is basically a model known to be Convolutional Neural Network and in recent times it has gained a lot of popularity because of its usefulness. CNN uses multilayer perceptrons to do computational works. CNN uses relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. This means the network learns through filters that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered. So, for the image processing tasks CNNs are the best-suited option."
