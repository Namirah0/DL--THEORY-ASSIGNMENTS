    "Ans:Protocol buffers are a method of serializing data that can be transmitted over wire or be stored in files. The other formats like JSON and XML are also used for serializing data. Although these platforms have proved themselves to be extremely flexible and effective, one place where they aren’t fully optimized is scenarios where the data is to be transmitted between multiple microservices in a platform-neutral way."
